  "transcript": "Hi guys, I'm very bored and have nothing better to do with my life right now. So what's more fun than to watch me learn one through 10 in five different languages.  French, Russian, Japanese, German, and Italian. Let's start with French.  Uh, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.  Okay, I'm done with French.  But I'm going to learn the only three. Oh, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.  I think, uh, the seat. Ah. Let's try Japanese.  This is Russian btw. I'm going to try my best, please don't judge.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. My pronunciation might be very off but let's do German now. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. That concludes my video. Thank you guys so much for watching.
