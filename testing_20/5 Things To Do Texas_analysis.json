  "transcript": "5 things to do in Fort Worth, TX that are not eating or drinking (stockyards). Up first, we have the cattle walk that happens daily at 11 AM and 4 PM. I've been to the stockyards twice and this is just such a fun thing to do. Next up, you could take a picture sitting on a steer, it costs about $10. There is so much shopping to do around here. you could shop for boots, hats, literally any western gear you could ever need. They definitely have it here. One thing I love about cowboys is the dancing. They've got line dancing and two-stepping. A must-go place for line dancing is Billy Bob's Texas, it's like iconic at the stockyards. Last but not least, you could go to a rodeo at the Cowtown Coliseum. I don't know how I didn't have any videos here, but it's such a good time. Let me know if you check out any of these spots or any other recommendations. have fun!! Bye."
