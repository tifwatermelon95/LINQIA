  "transcript": "Do you think it would be a better investment to own one 4.5 million dollar house or 15 $500,000 houses? Which would you prefer? I want 15! I mean, you've got one house, you don't have a tenant. You're in a bit of trouble, right? You've got 15 houses, someone moves out, who cares? I've got 14 other tenants. You've got to question the efficiency of your money."
