  "transcript": "y'all act like it's traveling is not expensive. so expensive to travel. literally not. there's budget travelling and there's vacationing and they are two completely different things. like they do not go together at all. there's vacationing where most people do where it's like you take a week or two out of the year on a few trips to an inclusive you stayed in a hotel and you spend like at least over $1,000 for that week. or there's budget travelling which is what I do. you go places for months on end. you take city buses. you eat meals under 50 cents. you sleep on the airport floor. you stay in hostels, homestays, people's living rooms. overnight buses. literally whatever you can do to find the cheapest sleep of your life. I've been budget traveling for two years now and I spend $700 a month on average. you can't even rent someone's garage in California for $700 a month. So for all y'all that comment that it's my dad's money and like there's no way that I can pay for this myself. fuck you. I pay for it all myself because it's literally not that expensive."
