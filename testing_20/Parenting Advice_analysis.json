  "transcript": "Stop being a lazy parent. Lazy parenting is not a mindset. They're focusing on all the things. Oh, I'll give you a toy, I'll give you an iPad. Oh, I'll put on cartoons. That's why your kids are messed up. Take all that off the table, focus on positive affirmations. Focus on positive thinking. Have them work on gratitude journals. Build systems in your home where your children start to learn and build the muscle of gratitude and appreciation. Watch things shift. We're clogging our children's filters with all the external things, not priority on the thing."
