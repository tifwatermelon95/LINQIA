And then I chose a book I wanted to read next, which was The Secret History by Donna Tartt. I was gifted this book a few years back. It's been on my radar for a while, so I was happy to finally be able to start it. And I really had no idea what to expect. All I knew was Dark Academia. But this book had me absolutely shook.

The video states this method helps plants absorb calcium, strengthens roots, stems, leaves, and fruits, and boosts resistance to diseases and harsh weather.","['Gardening', 'DIY']","['Tutorial', 'Tips and Tricks']",['Hands-only'],,"Food, DIY Projects, Props",,[],,"Did you know that if you crush eggshells into a mortar until they become a very fine powder and then mix them with lemon juice, they immediately start reacting and forming bubbles. This happens because eggshells are alkaline and lemon juice is acidic, and it's that acid that releases the calcium trapped inside the eggshell. If you let the mixture sit for 24 hours, most of the eggshell will dissolve into the juice. Then you can dilute it in a liter of water and you'll have a liquid fertilizer rich in calcium, perfect for applying at the base of plants and also on their foliage. This homemade method allows plants to absorb calcium faster, strengthening roots, stems, leaves, and fruits. Plus, it boosts plant resistance against diseases, nutrient deficiencies, and harsh weather conditions. With this method, you recycle kitchen waste, save money, reduce trash, and increase your garden's productivity naturally, ecologically, and effectively. The best part is that it's simple, affordable, and anyone can do it at home."

Now I'm intensifying the eye makeup with some black shadow and a bit of liner, smudging it out and making sure it's all blended. I've also made custom lashes using individual lashes from 'Shein'. At this point her eyes are still matte because I wasn't sure if I wanted to add shimmer. I do add shimmer in the end. Full foundation, I used House Labs and Estee Lauder Double Wear. And blush, I used Morphe and the Made By Mitchell Curve Case. This is like my favorite part of the makeup because I feel like you can really see everything coming together now with the contour and the blush placement, it's all coming together so nicely. It's looking so flawless and smooth. I'm just bronzing her up now. I'm just reinforcing everything that I've done with cream but with powder now. With the blush, I'll use like five different blushes. I'll use a matte blush, a shimmery blush. I just find that you get the perfect finish like that. For her lower lash line, I'm just using the same colors that I used for her eye shadow. For the shimmer, I used the Huda Beauty highlighter and just a bit of gloss from Maybelline. Honestly, this is just one of my favorite glams.

As I was following it, I ran out of air, so I decided to swim to the top. And from the top of the water, I saw a massive school of fish. Sometimes there's something tasty hiding in the school. So I went down to take a closer look, but when I didn't find anything, I waved them off and continued my search for what could be my breakfast. I stumbled across the most delicious fish in the sea, which is a lionfish. And when I took aim, I needed to make sure that I hit it good because these guys are destroying South Florida. That one fish wasn't going to be enough to feed me though, so I had to be extra stealthy. As I went across the bottom of the sea floor looking for what else I can eat. I swam up to this hogfish that thought it was completely camouflaged. And when it realized that I saw it, it turned its camouflage off and slowly started swimming away from me. Well, this fish is delicious. It has to be a minimum of 16 inches. And this guy was just a little too small."

The less stuff you own, the less stuff you have to clean, which is why I'm a minimalist. This is so cleanly becomes easier and much more efficient. Here are a few things that I do for a minimalist and clutter-free home. For a clutter-free kitchen sink area, there is no hand wash. Instead, I fill a soap dispenser with some fairy liquid. So we use that to wash our dishes but also to wash our hands. I only own one perfume which I wear every day and for every single occasion. It's now my signature scent. So when it runs out, I'll just purchase the same one. Following onto this, I do not own any ornaments. Instead, I make my everyday items the ornament. As you can see, this looks super cute. A few other ideas are storing toilet rolls in a wicker basket and also rolling up fresh white towels and storing them in the shower. Next, I own a very limited amount of mugs and glasses. There are only four people that live in the house. There's no need to have an excessive amount. Same goes for cutlery and the plates. This will prevent dishes from piling up, especially to those who like to eat food in their room. All of the kitchen appliances are stored away. So I've made space in the cupboards for each appliance. So anytime you need to use the appliance, just take it out, use it and then put it back. Saves so much space on the worktops. I do not own a toaster, so whenever I want toast, I'll just use the oven on the grill mode. However, the only appliance that is on display is the microwave because we use this multiple times a day. I don't own a cheese grater, instead I use a potato peeler to grate the cheese. I am not a big cheesy eater, so it didn't make sense to purchase a cheese grater. It actually works out really well, especially if you want cheese in a sandwich. It gets the perfect slices. Lastly, it's having fully empty surfaces. Makes it so much more efficient to clean. And I know it's not for everyone. It does look very empty and clinical. However, if you do choose to declutter a few of the items, it does make it much more efficient to clean. And that was it. I hope this video helps and thank you for watching. Bye."
