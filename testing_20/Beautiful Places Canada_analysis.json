It features a person jumping into a turquoise river surrounded by unique rock formations in Canada, a person walking on a boardwalk through a misty forest with decorative lights, and two people kayaking on a bright blue lake with snow-capped mountains in the background. The final segment shows a person walking through a colorful, wavy sandstone desert formation. Text overlays identify some locations as 'Canada' and 'The Wave', with a call to action 'Follow me'.",
