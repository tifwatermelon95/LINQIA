  "transcript": "guys I'm gonna spend a day with me as a first-year medical student I honestly haven't been recording a lot but I promise I'm gonna try to do better because it seems like you guys really liked the last video today was our second day of lectures and our dress code is business casual so I got ready for that in the morning I packed my lunch snacks and made my coffee with this homemade strawberry syrup that one of my classmates made for me which was so sweet of her Tyler made me a breakfast sandwich which I ate on the drive to school lectures from 8 AM to 12 PM and then we had an hour of lunch today was our first anatomy lab so everyone changed into their scrubs which was the coolest experience ever I'm so grateful we have donors that we get to learn from after lab we headed into a study room to review the lectures from this morning for a few hours then it was finally time to go home and take a shower Tyler made dinner for me I had pasta and salad and then it was right back to studying for the rest of the night just making sure I had all the concepts down for the same morning and it really is like drinking out of a firehose so much and just one lecture and it really is like a full-time job but I'm so lucky and happy to even be in this position especially since I worked so hard for it I just did some onki until I went to bed around 10:30 and that was my day bye"
