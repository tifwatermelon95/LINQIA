  "transcript": "POV: you realize wedding dress shopping in China is the best in the world. I flew from Toronto to Suzhou to buy my wedding dress. Why more brides don't do this. The wedding industry in China is on another level. This is called Huqiu Bridal City, which is 300,000 square meters of purely wedding dress and suit stores. There are six to seven malls in this complex and each mall is four stories high. The wedding dresses here are so beautiful and there's such an extensive collection of traditional wedding dresses and Western wedding dresses, suits, veils. and stores that only sell wedding fabrics. I went to New York to go wedding dress shopping and the selection here is even better. Quality ranges per store. So you have to make sure to feel the fabric and craftsmanship. Most of the stores have their own factories, so the dresses are all made to order. I fell in love with so many dresses here, but ended up custom making my own wedding dress. Also got two custom-made suits. My dress is gonna take a few more months, but I seriously can't wait to show you guys. Follow for more."
