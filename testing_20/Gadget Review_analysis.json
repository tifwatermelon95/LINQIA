  "summary": "The video shows a person unboxing and demonstrating a portable document scanner. They open a cardboard box containing the scanner, remove it, and peel off a protective film. The scanner is then shown in use, feeding a document through it. The person also uses a smartphone, presumably to control or interact with the scanner via an app. Finally, the scanner is placed into a protective pouch.",
