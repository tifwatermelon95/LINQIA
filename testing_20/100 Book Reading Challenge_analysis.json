  "transcript": "I love more than books is a challenge. So when I saw this 100 books bucket list scratch off challenge, I obviously had to get it. I started off by scratching off all the books that I had actually already read, just to make the challenge a little bit easier for me. And I'm not gonna lie, it was very precarious. And then I chose a book I wanted to read next, which was The Secret History by Donna Tartt. I was gifted this book a few years back. It's been on my radar for a while, so I was happy to finally be able to start it. And I really had no idea what to expect. All I knew was Dark Academia. But this book had me absolutely shook. This was my expression throughout the entire book. I've never read a book where I've spent so many on the characters. And I know this is a satire and some of the language was shocking. So just be warned because this book is mad. My brain is just completely scrambled. It's not a point and I know it's a satire, but some of the language was shocking. So just be warned because this book is mad. My brain is just completely scrambled."
