  "transcript": "The most expensive mistake I made in my life was paying for my own fear of money. 30 lessons by 30. Lesson #28. You ever go out to eat with family? Glance at the soda and get hit with, no. You think we're made of money?! Yeah, same. That was my upbringing. My parents never talked about finances, and that's true for half 51% of you too. As the daughter of a night market noodle stand worker, my only lesson was don't spend money. So I didn't even think about it. But then nothing felt in my means and I bitterly watched other people do \"rich people\" things? Like concerts, \"nice\" dinners, traveling, while I'm living paycheck to paycheck in the most expensive city. Rationing my leftovers across as many meals as possible. But avoiding money doesn't save you. It costs you. Emotionally and financially. Like I didn't know I could afford a 401k, so I didn't even try. I even had employer matching, which is basically free money. Financial health is health. It's a lifestyle. A habit. It's like working out and over time, you'll feel healthier. Here's my personal checklist. I follow to build my money foundations in my 20s. Take a screenshot. And yes, I will do a fuller series around money soon! Remember, money problems are hard, but avoiding them is harder. This is 30 lessons by 30. The next lessons come tomorrow. So follow for more."
