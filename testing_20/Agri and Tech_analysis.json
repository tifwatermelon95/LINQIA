  "summary": "The video demonstrates how to create a liquid fertilizer from crushed eggshells and lemon juice. The eggshells are crushed into a fine powder and mixed with lemon juice, which causes a reaction. This mixture is then diluted in water and sprayed onto plants, or the crushed eggshells are applied directly to the soil around plants. The video states this method helps plants absorb calcium, strengthens roots, stems, leaves, and fruits, and boosts resistance to diseases and harsh weather.",

  "transcript": "Did you know that if you crush eggshells into a mortar until they become a very fine powder and then mix them with lemon juice, they immediately start reacting and forming bubbles. This happens because eggshells are alkaline and lemon juice is acidic, and it's that acid that releases the calcium trapped inside the eggshell. If you let the mixture sit for 24 hours, most of the eggshell will dissolve into the juice. Then you can dilute it in a liter of water and you'll have a liquid fertilizer rich in calcium, perfect for applying at the base of plants and also on their foliage. This homemade method allows plants to absorb calcium faster, strengthening roots, stems, leaves, and fruits. Plus, it boosts plant resistance against diseases, nutrient deficiencies, and harsh weather conditions. With this method, you recycle kitchen waste, save money, reduce trash, and increase your garden's productivity naturally, ecologically, and effectively. The best part is that it's simple, affordable, and anyone can do it at home."
