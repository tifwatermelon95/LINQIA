  "transcript": "Hi, I'm Bella, the founder of Strange Luxury. We are in Copenhagen today. I will be answering some of your questions. I was living in Los Angeles at the time before Covid and I was using really expensive skincare and I swore by this 600 dollar hyaluronic acid serum. I thought to myself why can't I create these same incredible efficacious, clean, gentle formulas but half the price and make them accessible to my friends, my community and people around me. So everything is about nourishing the skin barrier, hydration and making you feel your best from the inside out."
