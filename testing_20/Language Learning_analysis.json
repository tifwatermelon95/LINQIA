  "transcript": "Hi guys. I'm very bored and have nothing better to do in my life right now. So what's more fun than to watch me learn 1 through 10 in five different languages. So my list of languages are French, Russian, Japanese, German, and Italian. Let's start with French. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, dix. Let's try Russian. Agin, dva, tri, chetyre, pyat, shest, sem, vosem, devyat, desyat. I think Let's try Japanese. Ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, ju. That concludes my video. Thank you guys so much for watching. If you guys liked the end of this, I still have a lot of practice to do but I would like to choose one of these languages and actually learn it, but yeah. Bye bye."
