  "transcript": "four things I absolutely avoid as a cardiac surgeon. Number one smoking. No question the single worst thing you can do for your entire body. Destroys your lungs, causes lung cancer, high cardiovascular risks, heart attacks and strokes. Don't smoke. Alcohol. Hate to break it to you, toxic. Toxic to every cell in your body. Your body, your rules, you decide for yourself. For me personally, removing alcohol from my life has probably been one of the most transformative decisions I've made as an adult. All the cool kids are doing it, give it a shot. Soft drinks, liquid death. Just don't drink them. Period. Done. Number four, avoid breads and pastas. Avoid the refined flours and wheats. Eighty percent of weight control is diet. Twenty percent is exercise. I guarantee you you can out-eat any exercise that you do. So be conscious about what you're putting in your mouth.
