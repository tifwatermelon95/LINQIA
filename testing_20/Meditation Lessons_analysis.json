  "summary": "The speaker explains that the breath connects the conscious and subconscious mind. She elaborates on the function of the frontal lobe, where conscious cognitive choices are made, and how conscious breathing can activate this area. She shares a scientific study about meditation, where 20 minutes of daily meditation over eight weeks resulted in a shrinkage of the amygdala and growth of brain cells in the frontal lobe.",

  "transcript": "Your breath connects the subconscious and your subconscious mind. So you're subconsciously breathing all day long and you're back here where your amygdala and your limbic system are. They tell stories all day. When you pause and you consciously take a breath, you light up this frontal lobe. Your frontal lobe is where you make conscious cognitive choices. It's where you control your thoughts. When you light up this, you're making better decisions. You're telling your story. You're accepting the instincts you want and rejecting the others. You want to elevate that asset more. Meditate. First time somebody told me I need to meditate, I was like, Yeah, I'm a scientist. That's woo-woo. I don't do the woo. I do the woo. Here's why. I got real scientific about it and dug into it. And I was like, Holy sh... Nike's. Every single paper I read has fascinating research with meditation, turns out in my mind, of mine, a neuroscientist at Harvard. I guess, a research... she took non-meditators, scanned all of their brains, put them through a 20-minute a day, eight week long meditation program, rescanned all of their brains, and 20 minutes, she changed the shape and function of every single person's brain. She shrunk the amygdala, she literally grew gray matter. She grew brain cells in the frontal lobe. Read that study, it was like, Hmmm... I need all the brain cells I can get."
