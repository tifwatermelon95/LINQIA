  "transcript": "Twisted Games was very hard for me just because I never expected Twisted Love to take off the way that it did. Sitting in front of me is the one and only woman that has created couples and stories and books that got the whole world falling in love with four different couples. Alex and Ava, Rhys and Bridget, Stella and Christian and Josh and Jules. Ana Huang. Welcome Cami's hotline. Thank you. It is so nice to be here. I'm trying to tone it down and not be fangirling right now. For the first book, Alex came just very clearly to me, just because he is kind of like the type of guy that I generally like reading about. I tend to like the more morally gray characters. Oh my god, don't we all."
