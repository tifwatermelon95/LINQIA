  "transcript": "If you hate cleaning, this video is for you. The less stuff you own, the less stuff you have to clean, which is why I'm a minimalist. This is so cleanly becomes easier and much more efficient. Here are a few things that I do for a minimalist and clutter-free home. For a clutter-free kitchen sink area, there is no hand wash. Instead, I fill a soap dispenser with some fairy liquid. So we use that to wash our dishes but also to wash our hands. I only own one perfume which I wear every day and for every single occasion. It's now my signature scent. So when it runs out, I'll just purchase the same one. Following onto this, I do not own any ornaments. Instead, I make my everyday items the ornament. As you can see, this looks super cute. A few other ideas are storing toilet rolls in a wicker basket and also rolling up fresh white towels and storing them in the shower. Next, I own a very limited amount of mugs and glasses. There are only four people that live in the house. There's no need to have an excessive amount. Same goes for cutlery and the plates. This will prevent dishes from piling up, especially to those who like to eat food in their room. All of the kitchen appliances are stored away. So I've made space in the cupboards for each appliance. So anytime you need to use the appliance, just take it out, use it and then put it back. Saves so much space on the worktops. I do not own a toaster, so whenever I want toast, I'll just use the oven on the grill mode. However, the only appliance that is on display is the microwave because we use this multiple times a day. I don't own a cheese grater, instead I use a potato peeler to grate the cheese. I am not a big cheesy eater, so it didn't make sense to purchase a cheese grater. It actually works out really well, especially if you want cheese in a sandwich. It gets the perfect slices. Lastly, it's having fully empty surfaces. Makes it so much more efficient to clean. And I know it's not for everyone. It does look very empty and clinical. However, if you do choose to declutter a few of the items, it does make it much more efficient to clean. And that was it. I hope this video helps and thank you for watching. Bye."
