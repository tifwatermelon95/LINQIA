  "transcript": "The boy found that the stream in summer was frozen. He reached out to touch the ice. The cold quickly spread to his whole body. Even when he stepped on the ice, it did not crack. However, as soon as he turned to leave, a crack suddenly appeared in the 10-meter ice layer. Not long after, the boy came back. He was horrified to find that the ice in the stream had melted. He bent down carefully to touch it. The water was no longer as cold as before. The boy then put a ball on the water and watched it disappear in front of his eyes. But the next second, the ball floated down from upstream. He thought it might be an illusion, but after careful inspection, he confirmed that it was the same ball. The boy decided to leave immediately. But at this moment, a familiar voice came from behind him. The boy, feeling the cold, turned around and found that the stream that once flowed was frozen again. The boy did not want to stay here. He walked through the forest and came to his mother's company. He saw a huge aircraft he had never seen before flying by. But when his mother appeared in front of him, the boy was completely shocked. He was only out for an hour, but his mother seemed to have experienced 30 years."
