  "transcript": "Is fashion political? Where fashion brand out of Palestine and we work with women and family owned businesses all across Palestine. They're experts in weaving, hand embroidery, and tailoring. The women that we work with, who are experts in hand embroidery and tailoring. We went from working with three embroiderers to now nearly 30. The important thing is that these women don't work in workshops. They work from home. They have complete freedom to decide how they spend their days and work is not the center of their lives, community is. And we share meals with them, cups of coffee.
