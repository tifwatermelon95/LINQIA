  "transcript": "Here we go. The Royal Formula Jonathan Castro. Who's coming out on top? Round three of the Formula Drift Pro Championship. Ben Noah initiates. Castro works his way up to the top. Not as close, but Noah settled in. Right there, fading in the smoke is Castro. Tire fire early on. Transitions into the second. Inside clip. Noah finding that side-Brake. Ripping on home. He is on fire. Literally figuratively."
