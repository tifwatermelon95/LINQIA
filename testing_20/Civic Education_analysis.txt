  "transcript": "Idiots who don't want to participate in the affairs of their nation. They think will just work in and of themselves. Then they are tribalists. And these tribalists, they think that they are only safe with people from their tribe. And tribe can mean people from the same culture, same language, same culture. Then they are citizens. Individuals who are responsible and know that when you want to be served, you must give those who have the desire and the intellectual capacity to serve you. In many societies, it is only a percentage of people that can be called citizens, not more than 5%. And if a society wants to grow in the right direction, civic education is what will help the idiot and the tribalist to become a citizen."
