They also show how to prepare a takeout container as a mini greenhouse. The easiest method is presented as placing cuttings in a jar of water, and another option is to make a propagation box. The video concludes by asking the viewer if they have a favorite propagation method.",

  "transcript": "Anyone who has grown a pothos knows when you bring home one you're actually bringing home many many more. Before you know it you'll have to give it a trim and you can't just throw those cuttings away. You can grow more plants. You can propagate them right into soil. My favorite method is using an old takeout container to create a mini greenhouse. The easiest method is to just throw them into a jar of water or you can make a prop box using damp sphagnum moss. Do you have a favorite method?"
