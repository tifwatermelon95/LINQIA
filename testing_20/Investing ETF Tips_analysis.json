  "transcript": "3 ETFs that took me to 6-figures by 25. I'm continuing to buy into 2026. The first ETF is VFV. VFV is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500, which is the 500 biggest companies in the United States. So when you buy this ETF, you buy a little piece of all of those companies. On average, this ETF returned about 10% per year. The second ETF that I'm gonna be buying is QQQM. This ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100, which is the top 100 companies in the tech sector. This ETF is a bit more volatile, so higher highs and lower lows. And the last ETF that I'm gonna be buying into 2026 is VEQT. This ETF is globally diversified, meaning that it invests in companies over all over the world, not just in the USA. Those are the three ETFs I'm gonna be continuing buying into 2026.
