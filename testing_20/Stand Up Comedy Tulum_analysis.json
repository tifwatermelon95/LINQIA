  "transcript": "If I was Mexican living in Mexico, I'd flip the whole script. I would I'd be like, You know what bro? We're building a wall. Okay? We're building a wall. You can't come to Cancun no more, Puto. How about that? How about that? White girls crying all across America. Oh my god, I wanted to go to Cancun for spring break. Why are they so racist? I don't understand. Now I have to go to Puerto Vallarta. That's also in Mexico. Oh my god."
