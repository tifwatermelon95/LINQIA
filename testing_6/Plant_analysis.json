  "transcript": "Anyone who has grown a Pothos knows when you bring home one, you're actually bringing home many, many more. Before you know it, you'll have to give it a trim and you can't just throw those cuttings away. You can grow more plants. You can propagate them right into soil. My favorite method is using an old takeout container to create a mini greenhouse. The easiest method is to just throw them into a jar of water, or you can make a prop box using damp sphagnum moss. Do you have a favorite method?"
