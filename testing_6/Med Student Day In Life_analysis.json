  "transcript": "Hey guys! Today was our second day of lecture in our first year medical student. I'm gonna try to do better because it seems like you guys really like the last video. Today was our second day of lecture. Our dress code is business casual, so I got ready for that in the morning. I packed my lunch, snacks, and made my coffee with this homemade strawberry syrup that one of my classmates made for me, which was so sweet of her. I ate a breakfast sandwich on the drive to school. We had lectures from 8 AM to 12 PM, and then we had an hour of lunch. Today was our first anatomy lab, so everyone changed into their scrubs, which was the coolest experience ever. I'm so grateful we have donors that we get to learn from. After lab, we headed into a study session to review the lectures from this morning for a few hours. And then it was finally time to go home and take a shower. Tyler made dinner for me, I had pasta and salad. And then it was right back to studying for the rest of the night. The amount of content is so overwhelming. It really is like drinking out of a fire hose. You learn so much and just one lecture and it really is like a full-time job, but I'm so lucky and happy to even be in this position, especially since I worked so hard for it. I did some Anki until I went to bed around 10:30 PM. That was my day. Bye."
