  "transcript": "Making your first beat can be intimidating, but it's easier than you think. Today, I'm breaking it down into three simple steps anyone can follow. Step one, start from the drums. Pick a basic drum kit. Go for a kick, a snare, and a hi-hat. Lay down a basic kick and snare pattern. Start with the kick on beat one and the snare on beat three. If you want to add a bounce, add some extra kicks and add the hi-hats on every beat. Nothing fancy, but it does have a groove. The bassline is what makes your beat feel powerful. Start with a synth bass. I like the \"wonk bass\" preset on Ableton. Keep your bassline simple, it's your first beat. I'll use the notes A, F, C, and G. Now add a melody. Pick an instrument like piano or a synth. I'll just pick piano, and here's a trick: try to stick to only three or four notes. Go make your first beat, post it, and tag me. I want to hear what you create."
