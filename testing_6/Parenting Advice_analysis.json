  "transcript": "Stop being a lazy parent. Lazy parenting is not a mindset. They're not focusing on all the things. I'll buy you a toy. I'll give you an iPad. I'll put on cartoons. That's why your kids are messed up. Take all that off the table, focus on positive affirmations. Focus on positive thinking. Have them work on gratitude journals. Have them work on appreciation. Build systems where children learn to learn gratitude and appreciation and watch things shift. We're clogging our children's filters with all the external things. Not a priority on the thing. Not the most important thing."
