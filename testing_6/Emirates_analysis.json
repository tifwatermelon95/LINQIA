A pilot walks through the cabin, and the term \"PAX\" is shown with its definition \"PASSENGERS.\" Next, a pilot in the cockpit explains \"ILS\" as \"INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM.\" A pilot in a darker uniform explains \"MDA\" as \"MINIMUM DESCENT ALTITUDE.\" Finally, a pilot inside the cockpit explains \"ETD\" as \"ESTIMATED TIME OF DEPARTURE.\" The video concludes with a pilot on the tarmac by a jet engine, with \"GS\" defined as \"GROUND SPEED.\"",
