  "transcript": "Hi guys. I'm very bored and have nothing better to do in my life right now. So what's more fun than to watch me learn one through 10 in five different languages. So my five languages are: French, Russian, Japanese, German, and Italian. Let's start with French. Uh. Okay. Okay. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, dix. Okay, so I think I'm done. I'm gonna try Russian. This is Russian, btw. I'm gonna try my best. Please don't judge. Odin, dva, tri, chetyre, pyat, shest, sem, vosem, devyat, desyat. Okay. My pronunciation might be like very off, but. Let's try Japanese. Ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, ju. That concludes my video. Thank you guys so much for watching. If you guys watched the end of this. I feel like a lot of practice to do, but I would like to choose one of these languages and actually learn it. But yeah. Bye bye."
