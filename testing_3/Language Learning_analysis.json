  "transcript": "Hi guys. I'm very bored and have nothing better to do in my life right now. So, what's more fun than to watch me learn 1 through 10 in five different languages? I'm gonna try my five languages. French, Russian, Japanese, German, and Italian. Let's start with French. Uno, dos, tres, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, dix. Oh, my mommy moved rooms. This is Russian, btw. I'm going to try my best, please don't judge. Odin, dva, tri, chetyre, pyat, shest, sem, vosem, devyat, desyat. My pronunciation might be like very off, but let's do German now. Einz, drei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs, sieben, acht, neun, zehn. That concludes my video. Thank you guys so much for watching. If you guys have the end of this, I feel like a lot of practice to do. But I would like to choose one of these languages and actually learn it, but yeah. Bye bye."
