  "summary": "The video shows a person creating a music beat using a keyboard and computer. The creator explains the process in three simple steps: starting with drums, then adding a bassline, and finally a melody. The video displays music production software interfaces and a virtual drum rack. The creator demonstrates how to lay down a kick and snare pattern, add extra kicks for bounce, and then adds hi-hats. For the bassline, they select a synth bass preset and use specific notes. For the melody, they choose piano and suggest sticking to three or four notes. The creator encourages viewers to make and share their own beats.",

  "transcript": "Making your first beat can be intimidating, but it's easier than you think. Today, I'm breaking it down into three simple steps anyone can follow. Step one, start from the drums. Pick a basic drum kit, go for a kick and a hi-hat. Lay down a basic kick and snare pattern. Start with the kick on beat 1 and the snare on beat 3. If you want to add a bounce, add some extra kicks and add the hi-hats on every beat. Nothing fancy, but it does have a groove. The bassline is what makes your beat feel powerful. Start with a synth bass. I like the 'Wonk Bass' preset on Ableton. Keep your bassline simple, it's your first beat. I'll use the notes A, F, C and G. Now add a melody. Pick an instrument like piano or a synth. I'll just pick piano. And here's a trick: try to stick to only 3 or 4 notes. Go make your first beat, post it and tag me. I want to hear what you create."
