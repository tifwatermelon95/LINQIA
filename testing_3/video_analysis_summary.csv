Keep watching to see how I've done it. Also guys, I'm offering one-on-one lessons, so reach out to me on Instagram if you're interested. First things first, always prepping the eyelids with some concealer, setting it down with powder. I'm just going in with a few transition shades. I'm focusing them on the outer corner of the eye and then just slightly dragging it through. I build them up first to the intensity that I like before I move on to the darker color. Now I'm intensifying the eye makeup with some black shadow and a bit of liner, smoking it out and making sure it's all blended. I've also made custom lash using individual lashes from Shein. At this point, her eyes are still matte because I wasn't sure if I wanted to add shimmer. I do add shimmer in the end. For foundation, I used Huda Labs and Este Lauder. And blush, I used Morphe and the Made by Mitchell curve case. This is like my favorite part of the makeup because I feel like you can really see everything coming together now with the contour and the blush placement. It's coming together so nicely. It's looking so flawless and smooth. I'm just bronzing her up now. I'm just reinforcing everything that I've done with cream, but with powder now. With the blush, I'll use like five different blushes, a matte blush, a shimmery blush. I just find that you get the perfect finish like that. For her lower lash line, I'm just using the same colors that I used for her eye shadow. For the shimmer, I used the Huda Labs highlighter. And now for her lips, I used the Spiffy from Morphe and just a bit of gloss from Maybelline. Honestly, this is just one of my favorite glam looks. It's just so stunning, so elegant, still glam without being too crazy. I'm obsessed. It's just so stunning."

Whenever you're hunting, you want to make sure that you're hiding behind any rock or coral so that the fish that you want to eat doesn't see you. I locked onto a large parrot fish and while these guys do look big and tasty, you're not allowed to spear them because they're protected here in Florida. As I was following it, I ran out of air, so I decided to swim to the top. And from the top of the water, I saw a massive school of fish. Sometimes there's something tasty hiding in the school, so I went down to take a closer look, but when I didn't find anything, I waved them off and continued my search for what could be my breakfast. I stumbled across the most delicious fish in the sea, which is a lionfish, and when I took aim, I needed to make sure that I hit it good because these guys are destroying South Florida. That one fish wasn't going to be enough to feed me though, so I had to be extra stealthy. As I went across the bottom of the sea floor, looking for what else I can eat. I swam up to this hogfish that thought it was completely camouflaged, and when it realized that I saw it, it turned its camouflage off and slowly started swimming away. Well, this fish is delicious. It has to be a minimum of 16 inches and this guy was just a little too small."
