  "summary": "The video demonstrates how to create a first beat using a digital audio workstation. It breaks down the process into three simple steps: starting with drums, adding a bassline, and then a melody. The creator shows how to select a drum kit, create a basic kick and snare pattern, add extra kicks for bounce, and then add hi-hats. For the bassline, they suggest using a synth bass, specifically the 'Wonk Bass' preset on Ableton, and keeping it simple with notes A, F, C, and G. Finally, they suggest adding a melody by picking an instrument like piano or synth and sticking to 3 or 4 notes. The video concludes with encouragement to create, post, and tag the creator.",

  "transcript": "Making your first beat can be intimidating, but it's easier than you think. Today, I'm breaking it down into three simple steps anyone can follow. Step one, start from the drums. Pick a basic drum kit. Go for a kick and a hi-hat. Lay down a basic kick and snare pattern. Start with the kick on beat one and the snare on beat three. If you want to add a bounce, add some extra kicks. And add the hi-hats on every beat. Nothing fancy, but it does have a groove. The bassline is what makes your beat feel powerful. Start with a synth bass. I like the Wonk Bass preset on Ableton. Keep your bassline simple, it's your first beat. I'll use the notes A, F, C and G. Now add a melody. Pick an instrument, like piano or a synth. I'll just pick piano. And here's a trick: try to stick to only 3 or 4 notes. Go make your first beat. Post it and tag me. I want to hear what you create."
