  "transcript": "Hi guys. I'm very bored and have nothing better to do with my life right now. So what's more fun than to watch me learn one through 10 in five different languages? So the five languages are: French, Russian, Japanese, German and Italian. Let's start with French. One, two, three, four, five. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Okay, my mommy be moving rooms. I'm gonna try my best. Please don't judge. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. That's Russian btw. Okay. Ah, let's try Japanese. E, ni, san, shi, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, ju. My pronunciation might be very off, but… Let's do German now. Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs, sieben, acht, neun, zehn. That concludes my video. Thank you guys so much for watching. If you guys watched to the end of this, I feel like a lot of practice to do, but I would like to choose one of these languages and actually learn it, but yeah. Bye bye."
