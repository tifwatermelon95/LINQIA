  "transcript": "Making your first beat can be intimidating, but it's easier than you think. Today, I'm breaking it down into three simple steps anyone can follow.\n\nStep one: Start from the drums. Pick a basic drum kit. Go for a kick, a snare, and a hi-hat. Lay down a basic kick and snare pattern. Start with the kick on beat one and the snare on beat three. If you want to add a bounce, add some extra kicks. And add the hi-hats on every beat.\n\nNothing fancy, but it does have a groove. The bassline is what makes your beat feel powerful.\n\nStep two: Start with a synth bass. I like the \"wonk bass\" preset on Ableton. Keep your bassline simple, it's your first beat. I'll use the notes A, F, C, and G.\n\nNow add a melody. Pick an instrument like piano or a synth. I'll just pick piano. And here's a trick: try to stick to only three or four notes.\n\nGo make your first beat, post it and tag me. I want to hear what you create."
