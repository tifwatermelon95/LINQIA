  "transcript": "Honestly, this is probably one of my favorite glam looks that I've done so far. Keep watching to see how I've done it. Also guys, I'm offering one-on-one lessons. So reach out to me on Instagram if you're interested. First things first, always prepping the eyelids with some concealer, setting the dust with powder. I'm just going in with a few transition shades. I'm focusing them on the outer corner of the eye and then just slightly dragging it through. I build them up first to the intensity that I like before I move on to the darker color. Now I'm intensifying the eye makeup with some black shadow and a bit of liner, smudging it out and making sure it's all blended. I've also made custom lash using individual lashes from Shein. At this point, her eyes are still matte because I wasn't sure if I wanted to add shimmer. I do add shimmer in the end. Full foundation I used, Huda Labs and Estee Lauder and blush. I've used Morphe and the Maybelline Cream Case. This is like my favorite part of the makeup because I feel like you can really see everything coming together now with the contour and the blush placement. It's looking so flawless and smooth. I'm just bronzing her up now. I'm just reinforcing everything that I've done with cream, but with powder now. With the blush, I'll use like five different blushes, a matte blush, a shimmery blush. I just find that you get the perfect finish like that for her lower lash line, I'm just using the same colors that I used for her eyeshadow. For the shimmer, I used the Huda Beauty highlighter and just to, like, do a little bit of gloss from Maybelline. Honestly, this is just one of my favorite glam looks. It's just so stunning, so elegant, still glam without being too crazy. I'm obsessed. And it's so effortless. I'm just bronzing her up now.
