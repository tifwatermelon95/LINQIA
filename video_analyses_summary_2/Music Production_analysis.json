  "summary": "The video demonstrates how to make a beat using a keyboard and digital audio workstation software. The creator explains the process in three simple steps: starting with the drums, adding a bassline, and then a melody. They suggest using a basic drum kit with a kick, snare, and hi-hat, and offer advice on creating a simple yet groovy bassline using a synth bass preset. For the melody, they recommend using a piano or synth and sticking to three or four notes. The video concludes with the creator encouraging viewers to make their own beat, post it, and tag them.",
