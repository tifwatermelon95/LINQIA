  "summary": "This video explains how to make your first beat in three simple steps. It covers starting with a basic drum kit, laying down a kick and snare pattern, adding extra kicks for bounce, and then adding hi-hats on every beat. The video then explains how to create a bassline using a synth bass preset and suggests using only three or four notes for simplicity. Finally, it encourages viewers to add a melody using an instrument like a piano or synth, and then to create and share their first beat.",

  "transcript": "Making your first beat can be intimidating but it's easier than you think. Today I'm breaking it down into three simple steps anyone can follow. Step one: start from the drums. Pick a basic drum kit, go for a kick and a hi-hat. Lay down a basic kick and snare pattern. Start with the kick on beat 1 and the snare on beat 3. If you want to add a bounce, add some extra kicks and add the hi-hats on every beat. Nothing fancy, but it does have a groove. The bassline is what makes your beat feel powerful. Start with a synth bass. I like the Wonk Bass preset on Ableton. Keep your bassline simple, it's your first beat. I'll use the notes A, C and G. Now add a melody. Pick an instrument like piano or a synth. I'll just pick piano. And here's a trick: try to stick to only 3 or 4 notes. Go make your first beat, post it and tag me. I want to hear what you create."
