  "transcript": "Hi guys. I'm very bored and have nothing better to do in my life right now. So, what's more fun than to watch me learn one through 10 in five different languages. French, Russian, Japanese, German and Italian. Let's start with French. Uno, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, dix. I'm going to learn the only three that I know, so that's uno, dos, tres, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, dix. I'm going to try Japanese. Ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, ju. My pronunciation might be like very off, but. Let's do German now. Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs, sieben, acht, neun, zehn. Last but not least is Italian. I love Italy so much. Uno, due, tre, quattro, cinque, sei, sette, otto, nove, dieci. That concludes my video. Thank you guys so much for watching. If you guys liked this, I feel a lot of practice to do, but I would like to choose one of these languages and actually learn it. But yeah. Bye bye."
