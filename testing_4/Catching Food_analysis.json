  "transcript": "Catching My Food. Location: South Florida. Whenever you're hunting, you want to make sure that you're hiding behind any rock or coral so that the fish that you want to eat doesn't see you. I locked onto a large parrot fish and while these guys do look big and tasty, you're not allowed to spear them because they're protected here in Florida. As I was following it, I ran out of air, so I decided to swim to the top and from the top of the water, I saw a massive school of fish. Sometimes there's something tasty hiding in the school, so I went down to take a closer look, but when I didn't find anything, I waved them off and continued what could be my breakfast. I stumbled across the most delicious fish in the sea, which is a lionfish. And when I took aim, I needed to make sure that I hit it good because these guys are destroying South Florida. That one fish wasn't going to be enough to feed me though, so I had to be extra stealthy as I went across the bottom of the sea, looking for what else I can eat. I swam up to this hogfish that thought it was completely camouflaged. And when it realized that I saw it, it turned its camouflage off and slowly started swimming away. Well, this fish is delicious. It has to be a minimum of 16 inches, and this guy is just a little too small."
